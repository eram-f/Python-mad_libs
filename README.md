The Madlibs Project is a fun and interactive text-based game built using Python. 
Madlibs are a popular word game where players fill in the blanks of a story with various parts of speech (such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to create a humorous and often nonsensical story. 
This project involves creating a script that prompts the user for specific types of words and then uses those words to complete a predefined story template.
